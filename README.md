#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-

#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var → function-scoped, can be redeclared, hoisted.

let → block-scoped, cannot be redeclared in the same scope, can be updated.

const → block-scoped, cannot be redeclared or updated (immutable reference).

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

forEach() → executes a function for each array element, returns undefined.

map() → transforms each element, returns a new array.

filter() → selects elements based on condition, returns a new array.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

const [a, b] = [1, 2];
const {name, age} = {name: 'Rafi', age: 30};

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Use backticks ` `` for strings with interpolation and multi-line support:
