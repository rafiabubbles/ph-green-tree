#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var → function-scoped, can be redeclared, hoisted.

let → block-scoped, cannot be redeclared in the same scope, can be updated.

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

filter() → selects elements based on condition, returns a new array.
